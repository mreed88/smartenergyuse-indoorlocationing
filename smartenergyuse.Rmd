## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Since the Date and Time columns are separate they will need to be combined within the dataset in order to convert them to the correct format to complete the appropriate analysis. Here is an example of how this can be done in R:#
#Creating one date+time column called DateTime (replace 'household_power_consumption' with the name of your data frame):#
household_power_consumption <-cbind(household_power_consumption,paste(household_power_consumption$Date,household_power_consumption$Time), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
colnames(household_power_consumption)[10] <-"DateTime"
household_power_consumption <- household_power_consumption[,c(ncol(household_power_consumption), 1:(ncol(household_power_consumption)-1))]
head(household_power_consumption)
#Converting date and Time format (replace 'household_power_consumption' with the name of your data frame):#
household_power_consumption$DateTime <- strptime(household_power_consumption$DateTime, "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")
household_power_consumption$Date <- as.Date(HHPC$Date, "%d/%m/%Y")
#Error in as.Date(HHPC$Date, "%d/%m/%Y") : object 'HHPC' not found
str(household_power_consumption)
#You might also use some of the functionality from DPLYR and TIDYR to perform the same task. Select (), Unite() and Mutate() are a few (of many) functions that might be helpful to you in performing this step.#
#Now that you have converted the date and time appropriately you can begin to obtain some information from the data set.
```
```{r}
summary(household_power_consumption)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
summarise(household_power_consumption)
groupby()

```
#1 Summarize the motivation behind the project, and its goals.
#2 State the project’s results.
#3 Back up the results with details, as needed.
#4 Discuss recommendations, outstanding issues, and possible future work.
#For an end user presentation, we recommend a structure similar to the following:
#1 Summarize the motivation behind the project, and its goals.
#2 Show how the model fits into the users’ workflow (and how it improves that workflow).
#3 Show how to use the model.
#Other data scientists will primarily be interested in the modeling approach that you used, any variations on the standard techniques that you tried, and interesting findings related to the modeling process. A presentation to your peers generally has the following structure:
#1 Introduce the problem.
#2 Discuss related work.
#3 Discuss your approach.
#4 Give results and findings.
#5 Discuss future work.
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
#begin by exploring some visualizations of the data and then to build predictive models that will demonstrate to our client how the data can be used to help a home owner to make decisions about altering power consumption. To provide immediate value, I'd also like you to provide the client with five business suggestions based on insights that you glean from your analysis.
