Increasingly, technology companies are applying data analytics techniques to the masses of data generated by devices such as smart phones, appliances, vehicles, electric meters, et cetera – the “Internet of Things”. The ability to deal with data of these types will prove to be a high-demand skill for data analysts as applications of

An Internet of Things technology start-up that wants to use Data Analytics to solve two difficult problems in the physical world:

Smart energy usage: Modeling patterns of energy usage by time of day and day of the year in a typical residence whose electrical system is monitored by multiple sub-meters.
Indoor locationing: Determining a person’s physical position in a multi-building indoor space using wifi fingerprinting
Use the R statistical programming language to perform visualizations, then to generate descriptive statistics and predictive models using time series regression techniques and statistical classifiers. Finally, present the results to the start-up’s management, explaining strengths and weaknesses of the approaches that were implemented and making suggestions for further improvement.
